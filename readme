# Notepad++ Highlighting for Markdown, Bespin theme

Because of limits of the generic Notepad++ user defined language lexer, highlighting is partial and a little buggy. But you can still get a lot out of it if you follow some simple style rules.

  + Use the `#` syntax for headers, not underlines.
  + Remember `*`, `_`, and `>` only highlight the first word they've marked down.
  + Use `+` for lists, or change it in the dialog to dashes. Asterisks will conflict with emhasis highlighting.
  + Horizontal rules should be 3 to 13 dashes, no spaces.
  + Nothing works if you start or end it inside a word.
